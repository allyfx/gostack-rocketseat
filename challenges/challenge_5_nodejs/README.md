### ❓ What is it?
GoStack is a Bootcamp provided by Rocketseat where students learn to be Full-Stack developers using Node.js, React and React Native technologies. During the course students have to go through several challenges, which they have to complete in order to obtain the certificate.

### 🎓 Challenge
In the sixth challenge the student must build an application for managing transactions by practicing the concepts learned in the module.

### 🚧 Built with
- NodeJS
- Typescript

### 💡 How to use
*First you'll have to use software that allows you to use separate routes, one as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).*
- Boot the server with the code `yarn dev:server`.
- You are not allowed to do a withdrawal if you don't have enough money.

#### ✒Routes
- `/transactions` -> As `GET` it allows you to list all the registered transactions and the balance.

- `/transactions` -> As `POST` it allows you to register a new transaction, you'll have to send a `JSON` with a `title` a `value` and a `type` that can be `income` or `outcome`, wich means income for deposit and outcome for withdrawals.
