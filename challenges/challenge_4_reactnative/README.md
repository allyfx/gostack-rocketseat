*To use this app you'll need an Android/iOS emulator, or you can built it on your phone using USB. You'll also have to use software that allows you to use separate routes, one as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).*
- Boot the [back-end server](https://github.com/allyfx/challenge_two_node) with the code `yarn dev`, and the front-end server with `yarn start`. But after build the app using `yarn android/ios` based on your phone.
- You can use the routes in Insomnia (or another software you use) to create new repositories, they will appear in the app after a reload. You can find the routes on the [back-end server](https://github.com/allyfx/challenge_two_node).
