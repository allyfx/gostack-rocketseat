### ❓ What is it?
GoStack is a Bootcamp provided by Rocketseat where students learn to be Full-Stack developers using Node.js, React and React Native technologies. During the course students have to go through several challenges, which they have to complete in order to obtain the certificate.

### 🎓 Challenge
In the tenth challenge, we created a new application called GoRestaurant to practice what we’ve learned about ReactJS so far. The application allows the user to add a new dish of food, passing the URL of the image that will be displayed, the name of the dish, the price and a short description. It also allows you to make the dish available or unavailable, edit the dish and delete it.

### 🚧 Built with
- ReactJS
- Typescript

### 💡 How to use
- Boot the fake api with `yarn json-server server.json -p 3333`.
